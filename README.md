### Useful resources

- [BEM & SASS](https://medium.com/laboratoria-how-to/creando-proyectos-css-mantenibles-con-sass-y-bem-54e013c7b1d9) - This helped me identify the possibility of reduce time when structuring and include styles to my websites.
- [BEM explained with an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvnzyXGkNY4&t=1555s) - This well explained video showed me how to get a better understanding of BEM and how to use it in my projects.
